The contents of this module can be included with the header
``hpx/modules/type_support.hpp``. These headers may be used by user-code but are not
guaranteed stable (neither header location nor contents). You are using these at
your own risk. If you wish to use non-public functionality from a module we
*strongly* suggest only including the module header ``hpx/modules/type_support.hpp``, not
the particular header in which the functionality you would like to use is
defined. See :ref:`public_api` for a list of names that are part of the public
|hpx| API.
